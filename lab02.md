### CSC 2310 Spring 2021

In this lab you will learn how to create diagrams using the StarUML environment. You will use the information contained in the **Problem Description** as context for creating the relevant diagrams(s).

#### Pre-work
* Installation of StarUML - if you have not completed the installation of StarUML, follow the instructions provided in Lab 00.


#### Problem Description
The V-Vend Vending Machine allows customers to buy various snacks and drinks from a kiosk. The display screen shows available products on an LED touchscreen and allows users to select their desired products. The system accepts credit cards, bills (\$1, \$5, \$10, \$20) and coins (nickels, dimes, and quarters). Once ordered, the system allows a user to take a refund by canceling the request. Once selected, the system dispenses the selected product and remaining change, if any. The system has a maintenance mode that allows a technician to reset the system, change the contents that are dispensed, change prices, and shutdown the unit.
